## The Short Version

**We don't collect any of your data. Period.**

Everything stays on your device. We have no servers, no analytics, no tracking, and no third parties. Your habit tracking, progress, and personal information never leave your iPhone.

## Privacy Policy

### Introduction

Daya ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle (or rather, don't handle) your information when you use the Daya mobile application (the "App").

### Information We Collect

**None.** 

We do not collect, store, process, or transmit any personal information or usage data. Zero. Zilch. Nada.

### Data Storage

All data you enter into Daya—including your habit tracking, streaks, calendar entries, quotes, and settings—is stored **locally on your device only**. This data is:

- Stored in your device's local storage
- Never transmitted to any server
- Never shared with any third party
- Never accessed by us or anyone else
- Completely under your control

### App Groups

Daya uses Apple's App Groups feature to share data between the main app and home screen widgets. This data sharing happens **entirely on your device** and allows your widgets to display your current progress. No data leaves your device.

### Notifications

If you enable notifications, Daya may send you:
- Daily habit reminders
- Inspirational quotes

These notifications are generated **locally on your device**. We do not collect any information about your notification preferences or interactions.

### Third-Party Services

We use **zero** third-party services. No analytics, no crash reporting, no advertising networks, no social media integrations. Nothing.

### Data Sharing

Since we don't collect any data, there's nothing to share. We do not sell, trade, or transfer any information to outside parties.

### Children's Privacy

Daya does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since we collect no data at all, the app is safe for users of all ages.

### Your Rights

You have complete control over your data because it lives only on your device. You can:

- Delete the app at any time to remove all data
- Use the "Reset All Data" option in Settings to clear your data
- Backup your data through iCloud (if you have iCloud backup enabled for apps)

### Changes to Your Data

Your data is yours. You can:
- View all your data in the app
- Edit any historical entries
- Delete specific data points
- Reset all data at once

### Security

Since your data never leaves your device, it's protected by your device's security measures (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID, etc.). We don't need to implement server-side security because there are no servers.

### Open Source

While Daya is not currently open source, we're committed to transparency. If you have questions about how the app works, contact us at foundation@kordovatek.com.

### Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the app and on our website. Since we don't collect your contact information, we can't notify you directly of changes—please check this policy periodically.

### International Users

Daya works the same way everywhere in the world: no data collection, everything stays on your device. GDPR? CCPA? We're already compliant because we don't collect anything.

## Technical Details

For the technically curious, here's exactly what happens with your data:

### Local Storage
- Habits, streaks, and settings: `UserDefaults`
- Shared between app and widgets via App Groups: `group.com.daya.daya`
- Never synced to cloud (unless you enable iCloud backup at the device level)

### No Network Requests
- The app makes **zero** network requests
- No API calls, no data uploads, no analytics pings
- Works completely offline

### No Identifiers
- No user IDs, device IDs, or advertising IDs
- No tracking pixels or beacons
- No fingerprinting

### Permissions Requested
- **Notifications** (Optional): For daily reminders and quote notifications
  - Generated locally on your device
  - No data about notifications leaves your device

### iCloud Backup
If you have iCloud backup enabled on your device, your Daya data may be included in your device backups. This is controlled by your device settings, not by Daya. You can disable app backups in your device's iCloud settings.

## Our Commitment

**Daya will always be privacy-first.**

This isn't a marketing claim—it's our foundation. We built Daya to help people build habits with compassion, not to harvest data. We don't have a business model that requires collecting your information. 

Daya is a non-profit project by the Kordova Tek Foundation. It will always be free, with no ads, no subscriptions, and no data collection.

**Technology in Service of Humanity** means building tools that serve you, not exploit you.
